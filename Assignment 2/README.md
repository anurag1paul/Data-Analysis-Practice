Pandas Introduction
===================

# Part 1
The following code loads the olympics dataset (olympics.csv), which was derived
from the Wikipedia entry on [All Time Olympic Games Medals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-time_Olympic_Games_medal_table),
and does some basic data cleaning.

The columns are organized as # of Summer games, Summer medals, # of Winter games,
Winter medals, total # number of games, total # of medals. Use this dataset to answer the questions below.

# Part 2
For the next set of questions, we will be using census data from the
[United States Census Bureau](http://www.census.gov/popest/data/counties/totals/2015/CO-EST2015-alldata.html).
Counties are political and geographic subdivisions of states in the
United States. This dataset contains population data for counties and states
in the US from 2010 to 2015.
[See this document](http://www.census.gov/popest/data/counties/totals/2015/files/CO-EST2015-alldata.pdf)
for a description of the variable names.
